Project title: Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Hub

Short overview: This open source project is a continuation of a previous capstoneâ€™s group efforts, which is available on SEG4910CapstoneProject repositories.  It is an Automated Cybersecurity Intelligence Reporting System that uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity related feeds to get cybersecurity news and research articles, analyze them, identify threat trends using ML models and assign scores for criticality, relevance and importance to Bell. Important indicators of compromise are mmapped to a local database. Some search functionalities to filter important articles are also available.
Our goal from this capstone is primarily to make the front end of the current web app more intuitive, user friendly and responsive to different screen sizes. The web app should allow analysts to sign up and sign in, and get security related information to the organization they are interested in. (The tool was primarily meant for Bell, but we aim to make it adaptable to any organization the user is part of, like uOttawa or Telus, though it depends on whether the client agrees or not), they should be able to manage and generate reports efficiently with important insight and have it sent to them by email. We also envision visually appealing statistics and graphics, as well as an AI powered chatbot to help the analysts analyze the content. The system would then be deployed to AWS infrastructure, so changes to the backend will occur. We aim to have the tool ready for use at the end of the capstone. More features might come out as we get more insight in the project and by getting more domain knowledge. The tool would be an excellent resource for cybersecurity analysts in order to detect threats rapidly, and act proactively to protect their organization infrastructure.
